# RepPal
RepPal is an encrypted file storage for IRS rep work, made for my father so he stops with the big accordion files and moves to electronic :). It is written in python then compiled into C# (.exe) to obfuscate the code and prevent it from being altered in a production environment. 


I'm almost completely self taught so this may be spaghetti, but it does what it's supposed to.
